	# 0 library -> nothing needed, library is always in the same place /data/bioinfo/scratch/breakseq_fastqs
	# 1 download -> we can override it by just having a FASTQ variable, even with 0 value override
		# If we want to override the download, we can set a directory with previous downloads
		# It has to be the directory with individual directories
