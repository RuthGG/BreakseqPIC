This version has the following updates compared to Previous version
1. Adapted for SVs of sizes <200 and >=50
2. Repeatmasker -s mode for insertions
3. Excecutables gone
4. Keep track of the inserted sequence and output it in the final file
5. output all the debug messages to the stdout, and leave the
stderr to report only errors and critical messages
6. For checking Config.txt, in addition to assume its in the executing
script dir, can you do one more check so that if Config.txt does not
exist in the executing script dir, then also check if its in one upper
dir? For example, if its not in Executales(any name)/Config.txt, then
check Executales/../Config.txt before it raises an error.
7. Requiring an addtional column: unique ID as input


For SVs >=200bp, recommend the following parameters:

For SVs of 50<=SV_Size <200bp, recommend the following parameters
Breakpoint_Classification_Pipeline_XJM_Jan122010.pl perl Data/new.del.txt        Data/new.ins.txt        Data/new.inv.txt        0.5     200     50      85      50      50      New_Feb062010 New
